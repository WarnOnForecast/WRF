Using parallel IO through the netCDF-4 interface

If you don't need compression, stop and go use pnetcdf (parallel-netcdf-1.9.0).

To use parallel netcdf-4, set the environment variable NETCDFPAR to the directory containing the lib and include directories, e.g.,

setenv NETCDFPAR /scratch/mansell/netcdf474par

(This will also cause configure to set NETCDF = NETCDFPAR to prevent conflicting libraries, and also will force NETCDF4=1)

The code assumes you want compression turned on, so netcdf-c version 4.7.4 or later is required. (Because otherwise just use pnetcdf since it is faster.) This in turn requires HDF5 1.10.3 or later. Netcdf-c can be build with or without pnetcdf enabled, but it is not used here through the netcdf-4 interface. (There is a separate IO option for PNETCDF that can be used).

Tests for development used the following:

parallel-netcdf 1.9.0 (--enable-relax-coord-bound --disable-cxx)
Hdf5 version 1.10.7 (--enable-fortran --enable-parallel)
netcdf-c 4.7.4 (--enable-netcdf-4 --enable-pnetcdf --disable-dap)
netcdf-fortran 4.5.3 (--enable-parallel-tests)

Other options as needed: FC=mpif90 F90=mpif90 CC=mpicc F77=mpif90 

IO output form for parallel netcdf-4 is 13 (io_netcdfpar=13 in Registry)
